"DESCRIPTION": In this task, I performed big data analysis using Python in Google Colab on an Amazon Sales dataset. The dataset was loaded, explored, and cleaned by converting price, discount, rating, and count fields into proper numeric formats. I conducted exploratory data analysis to understand product categories, pricing patterns, discounts, and customer ratings. Key insights were derived using summary statistics and value counts, demonstrating the ability to handle and analyze a large real-world dataset effectively.
