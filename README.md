"DESCRIPTION": In this task, I performed big data analysis using Python in Google Colab. I selected an Amazon Sales dataset from Kaggle and uploaded it into Colab. The dataset was loaded using pandas, and initial exploration was done to understand its structure, columns, and data types. I cleaned the data by converting price, discount percentage, ratings, and rating count columns into numeric formats by removing symbols and handling errors safely. After cleaning, I performed basic analysis such as checking category-wise product distribution, average ratings, discount trends, and price comparisons. Finally, the processed dataset and analysis were saved in a Jupyter Notebook and uploaded to GitHub as part of the internship submission.
